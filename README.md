## ðŸŽ® Level Validtor

This microservice was built as a professional challenge for an Israeli mobile gaming company.
It validates JSON-based game level configurations using schema validation and LLM-based logical review.

Tech stack: Node.js, AJV, OpenAI API, structured JSON output.

## Few-Shot Prompting

This project uses **few-shot prompting** to guide LLM with structured examples.
By providing examples of well-formed inputs and expected outputs, the model

- Understands domain-specific rules(reward vs. difficulty/time limit)
- Returns only structured JSON responces
- Remains determenistic and aligned with schema
