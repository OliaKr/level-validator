## ðŸŽ® Level Validator

This microservice was built as a professional challenge for an Israeli mobile gaming company.
It validates JSON-based game level configurations using schema validation and LLM-based logical review.

Supports flexible model switching between OpenAI models. You can specify the model(e.g gpt-4o-turbo, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo) directly in the request body. If no model is provided, it will automatically fall back to the default model defined in the .env file .

Tech stack: Node.js, AJV, OpenAI API, structured JSON output.

## Few-Shot Prompting

This project uses **few-shot prompting** to guide LLM with structured examples.
By providing examples of well-formed inputs and expected outputs, the model

- Understands domain-specific rules(reward vs. difficulty/time limit)
- Returns only structured JSON responces
- Remains determenistic and aligned with schema

## To install and Run ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliaKr/level-validator.git
cd level-validator

```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install

```

3. Create an .env file and Configue the LLM API Key

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
PORT=3000

```

4. Run the service

```bash
node index.js

```

5. To test the service you can use Postman or run the following command in the terminal

```bash
node test.js

```

## Test Examples & Outputs ðŸ§ª

To ensure both schema and logic are validated correctly, here are some examples of representative schenarios:

1. **Unbalanced Reward-Time Configuration** (Using gpt-3.5-turbo)
   A mid-level setup with too high reward and too short time limit.
   Expected to trigger feedback and suggested fixes.

2. **Balanced Easy-Level setup** (Using gpt-4o-mini)
   A properly configured easy-level input, used to confirm that the model recognizes well-balanced cases.

3. **Balanced Easy-Level setup** (Using gpt-4-turbo)
   A hard-level configuration with reward and time limit values outside the acceptable range for this difficulty.
